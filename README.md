## VMWare vCloud Director

This package provides the `vcd` package which offers
an interface to the VMWare VCloud Director API.

It's intentionally designed to make heavy use of built-ins and strings
in place of custom data structures and proper types. It also only implements
specific endpoints, and doesn't have full API coverage.
